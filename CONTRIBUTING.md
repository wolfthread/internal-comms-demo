## Before Getting Started

### Internal-Comms Front End

Currently, only the demo version is released, however, there will soon be the full stack with the backend released. Make sure you use the appropriate channels to make your contribution.

More information will be added here later on.

To get a sense for how the application works, please have a look at the wiki.

### Design Decisions

As an initial choice, Semantic UI was initially used for the project, however in a further release we are not rejecting the idea to bring in a more custom design.
